                            my interests and skills. I worked as a techie for the school musicals, contributing to the behind-the-scenes magic of 
                            our productions. During my senior year, I discovered a passion for coding, where I created my own video game and designed

                        systems, improving patient care, and understanding the complexities of the healthcare industry. Outside of academics, I was an 
                        active member of ROSAS, a group that provided a safe space for Hispanic women and allies. Together, we volunteered in the 
                        community and traveled to Austin, building meaningful connections and making a positive impact. I also joined the Black Student 
                        Association (BSA), where we fostered camaraderie through board games, card games, and outings to places like Main Event. 
                        These experiences not only enriched my education but also deepened my sense of community and teamwork.</p>
